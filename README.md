`lpadder` or `launchpadder` is a web application that
lets you play Launchpad covers directly from your browser.

It features projects management (projects are saved locally),
projects editing, playing, ....
It also have some utilities like an Ableton parser
that will give you more informations about an Ableton
launchpad project. (In the future, we wish to be able to
convert Ableton projects to Unipad projects or lpadder projects).
## Development news

- Projects can now be saved locally, we can create a new project, delete it, and enter in it.
- I am trying also to think about a structure for the projects (samples and lights array, ...).
- Opening a project leads you to his informations page.
- We (me and a friend) started to think about an UI for the app (very important haha...) 
- I need to create a navigation bar for projects path (informations, play, edit) to make the switch easier (like tabs)
- Merge my `launchpad-midi-converter` repository into this one to make the Launchpad's lights management easier.
