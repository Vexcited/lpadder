`lpadder` (pronounced `el padder` or `launchpadder`) is a web application that
lets you play Launchpad covers directly from your browser.

It feature project editing, playing, saving current project ...
It also have some utilities like an Ableton parser
that will give you more informations about an Ableton
launchpad project. (In the future, we wish to be able to
convert Ableton projects to Unipad projects or lpadder projects).

## Development news

- I am trying to think about a structure for the projects (samples and lights array, ...).
- Creating the process to open a project (.zip)
- Opening a project leads you to his informations page.
- I started to think about an UI for the app (very important haha...)
  - About that, I drawn one, but now idk how to implement it ahahahah.... 
- I need to create a navigation bar for project path (informations, play, edit) to make the switch easier (like tabs)

- I'm actually trying, also, to improve projects management (new design !)
